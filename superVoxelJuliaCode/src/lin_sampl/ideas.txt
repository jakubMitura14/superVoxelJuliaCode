Non isovolumtric support
We need to change trilinear interpolation and variance to such that support spacing
When we will add support for non isovolumetric spacing remember to alter addition of cooridinate values in set_tetr_dat Lux layer call



1) add sampling of image transformed by stationary wavelet transformed
2) in the apply weights to loc_kern we can add parameters that look at the image and multiplies/add ... with vector of given direction to add to weights directionality info
